######################################################### xoblite bb3 | RC1 | 0.5.12.31 ##########

[changed Settings.cpp/h, *.cpp 12/29/2005 qwilk]
- For fans of the original xoblite bb1 slimline rendering, it is now possible to disable the use
  of marginWidths as well as force font sizes to <= 12 by enabling "Slimline metrics" in the xoblite
  Configuration menu (global setting, saved as xoblite.slimline.metrics: <bool> in extensions.rc)
- Removed the config option to disable style extensions (configuration menu item and matching
  extensions.rc setting) as it was deemed no longer necessary given the multitude of new settings
  and the introduction of the bb4nix 0.70 syntax

[changed CommandItem.cpp 12/5/2005 qwilk]
- Added a bsetbg command option to the mid click on menu [exec] items functionality,
  for further information see the entry from 1/4/2005 below... :)

[changed Slit.cpp 12/5/2005 qwilk]
- Manual positioning of the slit now requires ctrl+drag (same behaviour as the toolbar/systembar)

[changed Settings.cpp/h, Toolbar.cpp/h, ToolbarMenu.cpp, CommandItem.cpp 12/4/2005 qwilk]
- Manual positioning of the toolbar using ctrl+drag is now supported
  (saved as session.screen0.toolbar.placement: Manual x<int> y<int> in blackbox.rc)
- It is also possible to configure if the toolbar window should snap to the screen edges when
  in manual positioning mode (configurable from the toolbar menu, item visible only when in
  manual positioning mode, setting saved as xoblite.toolbar.snapToEdges: <bool> in extensions.rc)

[changed Settings.cpp/h, Systembar.cpp/h, SystembarMenu.cpp, CommandItem.cpp 12/3/2005 qwilk]
- Manual positioning of the systembar using ctrl+drag is now supported
  (saved as xoblite.systembar.placement: Manual x<int> y<int> in extensions.rc)
- It is also possible to configure if the systembar window should snap to the screen edges when
  in manual positioning mode (configurable from the systembar menu, item visible only when in
  manual positioning mode, setting saved as xoblite.systembar.snapToEdges: <bool> in extensions.rc)

[changed Settings.cpp/h, MenuMaker.cpp 12/1/2005 qwilk]
- Complete rewrite of the style parsing engine (reduced the size of the .exe by 5kB)
- A side benefit of this rewrite is more or less full support for bb4nix 0.70 style syntax,
  including borders for all elements and a few safeguards for a flawed mix of old and new syntax... :P
- Another benefit is that it allows for even more comprehensive configuration than before, e.g.
  different fonts for toolbar.label/windowLabel/clock - basically all settings for all elements! :D
  (not that I recommend you go crazy with it, but it *is* supported... <vbg>)
- Added support for menu.title/frame.marginWidth (used if defined, otherwise classic xoblite slimline)

[changed Toolbar.cpp/h, Systembar.cpp 11/28/2005 qwilk]
- Added support for dynamic resizing of the toolbar and systembar based on font size(s)

[changed Slit.cpp/h 11/10/2005 qwilk]
- Lowered the slit reconfigure lock from 500 milliseconds to 300 milliseconds... ;)
  (theoretically this should make style changes, reconfigure and restarts feel snappier)

[changed BBApi.cpp/h 11/9/2005 qwilk]
- Added a new xoblite application environment variable -> $Clipboard$
- When parsed $Clipboard$ will be replaced by the text string present in the clipboard
  (however please note that e.g. menu items are parsed at startup, which means they are
  static, but e.g. hotkeys are usually parsed dynamically)
- Example: @Script [mailto:address@isp.com?subject="$Clipboard$"]

[changed Systembar.cpp/h 11/7/2005 qwilk]
- Alt+Mid clicking on a taskbar button will now shade/unshade the corresponding window

[changed Toolbar.cpp/h 11/7/2005 qwilk]
- Substantial streamlining of the toolbar painting code (more aggressive caching etc)

[changed Settings.cpp/h, Systembar.cpp, SystembarMenu.cpp, CommandItem.cpp 11/2/2005 qwilk]
- It is now possible to configure if inactive task buttons should have a background or not,
  using the "Inactive task background" menu item in the taskbar submenu
- Saved as xoblite.taskbar.inactive.background: <bool> in extensions.rc (theme specific setting)
- The default setting is background disabled, because I think it looks really nice and
  blends well with the active and flashing task buttons

[changed Blackbox.cpp, Systembar.cpp/h, Settings.cpp/h 11/2/2005 qwilk]
- Added support for flashing task buttons! :D (again by popular demand, including myself...)
- The colours used for the flashing task buttons are the active task button colours,
  but inverted and then transformed RBG->BGR (i.e. automatically configured by xoblite)
- It is possible to disable task flashing if you find it annoying (or fugly) using the
  "Disable task flashing" menu item in the taskbar submenu
- Saved as xoblite.taskbar.flashing: <bool> in extensions.rc (theme specific setting)

[changed Desk.cpp, Menu.cpp 11/1/2005 qwilk]
- Merged in two multi-monitor bug fixes provided by viceroy (thanks Stuart!)

[changed ToolbarMenu.cpp, SystembarMenu.cpp, SlitMenu.cpp 10/31/2005 qwilk]
- Rearranged the placement submenus similar to the bb4nix 0.70 layout (made sense)

[changed Systembar.cpp, SystembarMenu.cpp 10/31/2005 qwilk]
- All taskbar modes (Bars/Icons/Bars+Icons) are now supported also when placed on the toolbar

[changed Settings.cpp 10/30/2005 qwilk]
- The default menu bullet is now "Triangle" (i.e. if not specified in the style - same as in *nix?)

[changed Toolbar.cpp/h, Systembar.cpp/h, Settings.cpp/h, SystembarMenu.cpp/h 10/29/2005 qwilk]
- By popular demand: The taskbar can now swap places with the toolbar windowlabel! :D
  (i.e. making it possible to place the taskbar on the toolbar a la fluxbox)
- Toggle placement from the taskbar submenu in the toolbar/systembar menus: "Taskbar<->WindowLabel"
- Saved as xoblite.taskbar.placement: <Systembar/Toolbar> in extensions.rc (theme specific setting)
- Please note that xobloon notifications will still be displayed on the systembar
  (i.e. temporarily replacing the windowlabel if the taskbar is placed on the toolbar)
- Optimized the toolbar gradient rendering code (e.g. including caching of gradients)

[changed MenuMaker.cpp 10/23/2005 qwilk]
- Wildcard search patterns are now supported for menu [path] items (previously predefined *.*)
- Example: [path] (executables) {"$Blackbox$\*.exe"}

[changed MenuMaker.cpp 10/22/2005 qwilk]
- Added simple menu [path] folder merging using the | character as separator, e.g.:
  [path] (start) {"$StartMenu$"|"$CommonStartMenu$"}
- "Simple" means no checking for duplicates since this would require too much
  additional processing to be worthwhile
- Right clicking on a [path] item with merged folders will open the first folder in Explorer
- Made the example above the second entry (after the Explorer file manager entry)
  in the default menu.rc in an attempt to be slightly more n00b-friendly... ;]

[changed Settings.cpp, Painter.cpp, Toolbar.cpp 10/10/2005 qwilk]
- Added limited (for now) support for the "border" gradient type/appearance definition
  and the related style settings menu.hilite.borderColor, toolbar.label.borderColor,
  toolbar.windowLabel.borderColor and toolbar.clock.borderColor
- Plugin developers should note that the "border" type definition is not parsed by ParseItem,
  as doing so would break older plugins compiled using the first generation StyleItem definition
  (one of the drawbacks of using structs and then changing them, see below...)

[changed BBApi.cpp, Settings.cpp 9/29/2005 qwilk]
- Miscellaneous workarounds due to some bbLean "experimental" changes to the StyleItem
  definition also ending up in and being used by certain plugins... (e.g. bbIconBox)
- Maybe we should consider assembling a *box API standards committee or something? (just an idea)

[changed BBApi.cpp 9/26/2005 qwilk]
- Added the bb4win/bbLean GetDesktopInfo function to the the API for compatibility with bbIconBox

[changed BBApi.cpp 9/25/2005 qwilk]
- Fixed GetTask always returning NULL (which caused all BBTaskMenu menu item titles to be empty)

[changed TrayManager.cpp 5/17/2005 qwilk]
- Fixed an issue with the xobloon implementation that was affecting e.g. Miranda IM tray icons
  (thanks for the heads-up Edgeman!)

[changed TrayManager.cpp 5/16/2005 qwilk]
- Added regular balloon tooltip timeouts to the xobloon notifications
  (apparently people getting lots of xobloons got tired of clicking on them... =] )

[changed Systembar.cpp 5/16/2005 qwilk]
- Now filtering out Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.0 "offscreen" windows to avoid non-functioning duplicates
  (for which the window class is "AcrobatOffscreenDocumentWnd")

[changed TrayManager.cpp 4/16/2005 qwilk]
- Temporarily disabled the NIF_ICON requirement when adding icons to the system tray (NIF_ICON
  being a system tray flag indicating that the icon passed on to the tray is valid), because
  certain applications forget to set this flag (including Azureus, so please pass this on to the devs:
  -> http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/structures/notifyicondata.asp )
- Now filtering out "empty" balloon tooltip messages (sent by some apps, for unknown reasons... <g>)

[changed Systembar.cpp 3/31/2005 qwilk]
- Drag'n'drop of files onto task buttons is now supported (not utilized by all apps though)

[changed TrayManager.cpp, Systembar.cpp 3/24/2005 qwilk]
- Introducing a xoblite style balloon tooltips replacement - xobloon notifications! =]
- Instead of displaying the balloon tooltip in the non-*box-look'n'feel default Windows style,
  the tooltip information is shown on the taskbar (momentarily replacing the taskbar buttons)
  as a clickable button (i.e. when you click the tooltip button it is dismissed and the
  regular taskbar buttons are shown again)
- I think this a pretty good solution when you consider that the idea behind the balloon
  tooltips is a notifier kind-of-thing. After all, you can not miss the xobloon notifications,
  nor are they in the way or detracting from the *box experience! :D
- Please note that I have not yet bothered implementing buffering of notifications, so each new
  notification will replace a previously existing one (but given how uncommon balloon tooltips
  are in the first place, and how non-frequently they pop up, this should be a very minor issue)
- Finally, this feature can be disabled from the xoblite Configuration menu (theme specific
  setting, state saved as xoblite.systembar.xobloon.notifications: <bool> in extensions.rc)
  just in case the user or theme creator prefer using e.g. the "BBBalloon" plugin by kana

[changed Systembar.cpp 3/24/2005 qwilk]
- It is now possible to trigger move/resize mode for a task window
  by Shift+Alt+LeftClick/Shift+Alt+RightClick on its taskbar button

[changed Menu.cpp, Desk.cpp 3/20/2005 qwilk]
- Merged in a couple of multi-monitor bug fixes provided by viceroy (thanks Stuart!)

[changed Blackbox.cpp 3/20/2005 qwilk]
- Added two new core broadcast messages: @xoblite MinimizeAll/RestoreAll
  (minimizes/restores all windows, requested by stanna)

[changed Settings.cpp, DesktopMenu.cpp 3/8/2005 qwilk]
- Started implementing support for the new style syntax in bb4nix 0.70
  (...please note that xoblite's built-in buffer will automatically take
   care of the syntax conversion for plugins etc! :D )

[changed PluginManager.cpp 1/21/2005 qwilk]
- Now deleting the update.log file before downloading new repository/metafile information
  (security precausion just in case all downloads fail, i.e. always starting with no information)

[changed Systembar.cpp 1/21/2005 qwilk]
- Now passing mid mouse button clicks to tray icon applications (previously left/right only)

[changed Systembar.cpp 1/7/2005 qwilk]
- It is now possible to close an application by Alt+Shift+MidClicking on its taskbar button
  (requested by Stuart Turner (viceroy))
- ...be careful though, you will not get a warning unless the application give you one... <g>

[changed CommandItem.cpp 1/4/2005 qwilk]
- Holding down they control key while mid clicking on a menu [exec] item now copies the
  path *without* the Blackbox directory if the file is in a subfolder of this directory
- This is useful e.g. when browsing your wallpapers folder from the menu - when you find
  a wallpaper you like you can either MidClick on it to copy the full path to the wallpaper,
  or Ctrl+MidClick on it to copy the path without the Blackbox directory, which can then
  be pasted directly into a bsetbg rootCommand! :D
- Examples:
  c:\Blackbox\backgrounds\wallpaper.jpg -> "backgrounds\wallpaper.jpg"
  c:\Blackbox\themes\mytheme\backgrounds\wallpaper.jpg -> "$CurrentTheme$\backgrounds\wallpaper.jpg"
[updated CommandItem.cpp 5/12/2005 qwilk]
- If the alt key is held down too a bsetbg -full command including the path as argument is created:
  c:\Blackbox\backgrounds\wallpaper.jpg -> rootCommand: bsetbg -full "backgrounds\wallpaper.jpg"

[changed TrayManager.cpp 1/4/2005 qwilk]
- Was not refreshing the cached task button gradients when a tray icon was removed

[changed Blackbox.cpp 1/3/2005 qwilk]
- Added support for double clicking on .style files (assign extension to Blackbox.exe)
- It is now also possible to apply a style using Blackbox.exe <style path>
  Example: Blackbox.exe C:\Blackbox\styles\x-coal

[changed MenuMaker.cpp 1/2/2005 qwilk]
- Now filtering out .3dc files (as used by e.g. BBColorEx) present in [stylesmenu] folders

[changed BBApi.cpp, Desk.cpp, Slit.cpp, Systembar.cpp, Toolbar.cpp, Workspaces.cpp 1/2/2005 qwilk]
- Minor changes to the code adding basic support for 64-bit Windows (for more information see
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winprog/winprog/64_bit_windows.asp ,
  e.g. replacing GetWindowLong with GetWindowLongPtr and GCL_HICONSM with GCLP_HICONSM)
- Should be backwards compatible according to Microsoft... ;)
- Thanks to Stuart Turner (viceroy) for the heads-up, suggestions and testing
