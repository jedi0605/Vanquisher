-------------------------------- 
Version 3.90 -> Released 4/24/13    
--------------------------------
Fixed painting bug with the Path Bar. 
Added ability to send an ISO file to Windows Disk Image Burner. Don't know why,
unless it is because I never remember it is in the context menu. Sadly, need
Windows 7 and up to use. Under File menu. 
Added ability to create an ISO image from a data CD. Under File menu. Works on
XP and up. Does not create ISO images of audio cd.
Fixed bug in Drive toolbar refreshing incorrectly.
Added the ability to open Registry Editor to a qualified key. This was something
I needed and if others find useful we will try to enhance it. Under Tools menu.
Just type in or paste a key and hopefully regedit will open to the key.
Example:  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft 
Removed the status bar at the bottom. Hints now shown in the title bar. Panel in
file view will open on zip operations.
Fixed the No Row Color for the Browse for Folder dialog not working.
Change to language.ini.                                 
-------------------------------- 
Version 3.80 -> Released 4/16/13   
--------------------------------
Added option to show system Folder Options. Under Tools menu.
Added option to show system Remove Programs. Under Tools menu.
Added option to open Registry Editor. Under Tools menu.

Added option to toggle alternate row color.
Added option to copy file or folder to new name. Under Edit menu.

-------------------------------- 
Version 3.70 -> Released 3/13/13
-------------------------------- 
Just a fast fix to the Path Bar not being editable. Thanks Gary.
No change to language.ini.
--------------------------------
Version 3.60 -> Released 1/26/13
--------------------------------
Finally back and able to do a little. Sorry to all that I have been gone so
long but medical issues have me going sorta slow. And, I lost a couple of drives
so when I was able to try and begin again I had lost code and all my to-do
lists. So if you have not given up on me please email your requests and I will
do my best to work them in if possible. For those wanting A43 in 64 bit it will
not happen, sorry. It will take a complete rewrite and I do not know/think it
will be possible using the code base I have. I have written a simple file
manager and text editor I use in PE situations that I intend to post here in a
few days. These are simple but do allow me to do the work I need in PE. Perhaps
from this I can start a new file manager (A54?) if I receive feedback. They are
x86 and x64 so you can give them a go if interested.
A43 now has option to toggle real file size versus formatted file size for
feedback in the statusbar.
Option to hide folders in the file list. (Not persistent between sessions.)
Option to toggle the showing of selected file size. This speeds it up greatly
on a slow network. I will try to rewrite this function to not be recursive as
it is now and that should help the slow down.
I found some sloppy code and cleaned it up and in the process of this plus
going back to old code I have lost some of the request changes I had added, so
if you see it missing email me and I will get it back, hopefully.
Again, sorry to be gone for so long. But, I do give thanks and praise to God
through Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior for His strength daily and allowing me
to even be able to try writing code again. His peace to all...
-------------------------------- 
Version 3.50 -> Released 4/15/11
--------------------------------
A43 now uses the 7z.dll by Igor Pavlov to extract archive
types of .7 .iso .rar .cab .jar .tar .z .msi .arj .lzh .lha.
The interface is not exactly elegant but will do for now. I
was very excited to get this working since I need access to these
files and usually from a PE environment.
PLEASE NOTE: at present there is no way to cancel the extraction once
started and files will be over written if they exist. All archives
will be extracted to a folder using the archive name now, there is no
longer an option for this. All .zip work is still done internally as before.
Also, I was able to squash some bugs while completing this version. 
The 7z.dll is Copyright (C) 2011 Igor Pavlov. Many thanks
to him for his great lzma work. Visit 7-Zip here: http://www.7-zip.org/faq.html
The unRar.dll is no longer needed so it can be removed.

Make-shift FTP support. Will let you navigate your FTP site

ftp://username:password@address:port The port number of course is only needed
if not the usual port 21. You will need to use both file managers, one local
and the other your server since no node support. Double-click in the white space
to go to parent folder on the server. (file list) Do not use middle mouse button gestures or
