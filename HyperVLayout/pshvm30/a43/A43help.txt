 A43 File Management Utility - Version 3.90
 Copyright 2001-2013   Bradley G. Miller,  all rights reserved.


 Thanks for trying A43! This help is brief, assuming you know what a file 
 manager is and how to use it. What this help will do is fill you in on the extras 
 that A43 offers. A43 was created for my personal use but I have decided to 
 let others have a go too.


 CREDITS
 -------
 First and foremost I want to thank all those in the development community
 that have so graciously shared with me over the years. Some components
 used in A43 have been made available that others might learn and to
 those I am forever grateful. I thank you and salute you.

 CHANGES
 -------
 Please read the changes.txt file to stay current. I do not update this file.
 Perhaps someday will have html help.

 USING THE BUILT IN ZIP FEATURE
 ------------------------------
 You can drag-n-drop zip files for easy extraction or select the zip file you want 
 to unzip then select unzip from the file menu or click the unzip button.

 To compress files simply select the files and drag-n-drop or select the files then 
 select zip from the file menu or click the zip button.

 NOTE: If you choose to check Relative Path, only the relative path will be 
 stored in the archive,  meaning files will have no path information saved while
 folders will have the path information stored with any files they contain.
 If Relative Path is not checked then the path information is stored for both
 files and folders.

 ALSO NOTE: If a folder you want to archive is empty then it will not be
 stored. To insure it is included place a dummy file in it. For example, place a
 zero byte text file there.

 SELF-EXTRACTING ARCHIVES
 ------------------------
 Drag-n-drop zip files or select zip files then select Make EXE from the file
 menu or click the EXE button. Multiple archives can be converted at one time
 but if they are huge give  A43 time to convert them. There is no abort for this
 operation. The converted files will remain in the same folder as the original zip
 files.

 CHANGING DATE/TIME STAMP OF FILES
 ---------------------------------
 Select the files you wish to alter then select Set File Date/Time from the file 
 menu. A dialog will be presented with the current date/time ready to apply 
 or change the date/time then click apply.

 QUICK LAUNCH AREA
 -----------------
 Here you can create shortcuts to your favorite programs or files.
 Click the New Shortcut button on the toolbar to start the wizard
 or simply drag-n-drop the file and a shortcut will be created.

 FM EXTRA
 --------
 This simply mimics the file manager to allow an extra work area. The menus
 and toolbars are not active for this area. However, drag-n-drop and context
 menus are implemented. Right-click an object to perform an operation.

 FAVORITE BUTTONS
 ----------------
 Drag-n-drop a folder onto the Favorites then select which button you
 wish to set. Now this button will take you there.

 TEXT EDITOR
 -----------
 Use the Text Editor to edit text files and to quickly store them in a zip file.
 Drag-n-drop a file on the editor to open it for editing.
 To activate the popup menu press Ctrl+Alt+M while the editor is active.


 NAVIGATE
 --------
 Use Ctrl+Alt+LeftArrow and Ctrl+Alt+RightArrow for the Back/Forward buttons.
 Use Ctrl+Alt+UpArrow to go ot the parent folder.
 NOTE: The file view must have the focus.
 Use F7 to open/close the splitter.

 FIND FILE
 ---------
 Enter your search criteria then click find. Double-click a file shown from
 the search to go to the file.


 COMMAND-LINE PARAMETERS
 -----------------------
 You can instruct A43 to open to a specific directory by passing the path:
     c:\temp

 You can instruct A43 to open a text file by passing the path to the file:
     c:\temp\myfile.txt

 You can instruct A43 to start with a certain file filter by passing the filter:
     /ext=*.txt;*.ini;*.bat

 You can instruct A43 to use a different ini directory by passing the path
 you wish to use:
     /ini=c:\temp

 NOTE: The directory you pass must exist.

 You can instruct A43 to use a different 'links' directory by passing the path
 you wish to use:
     /links=c:\temp

 NOTE: The directory you pass must exist.

 A43 will scan the entire command-line for your parameters. Seperate each
 parameter with a space.
     c:\myfolder   /ini=c:\temp 
     c:\myfolder\myfile.txt   /ini=c:\temp 
     /ini=c:\temp /links=c:\temp c:\myfolder c:\myfolder\myfile.txt

 A43 is constantly evolving so your feedback is welcome, positive or not. 
 I hope A43 works for you.
